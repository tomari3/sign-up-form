# Sign-up form.

    In this little project i'll implement newly learned intermediate skills of HTML and CSS, ill write my code finer and potent, using emmet and form in HTML,
    and in CSS i'll use vars, complex selectors and calc, min, max.

    # Inspiration
    after strolling around the web looking for inspiration I found on Bechance a mockup of a sign up form made by Joshua Wilcox made for Unsplash called Glassmorphism.
    https://www.behance.net/gallery/124931411/Glassmorphism I like the transparent glass like design and wonder how I can apply it with CSS using calc and gradients.

    # Pseudo-code
    Although its not common practice to Pseudo-code a design I'll do one for the sake of efficiency and premature problems solving.

    Set a section with an Header and Subheader to act as a side bar.
    Set a section with two DIVs containing the form Header and the form
    Set HTML construction with the following items and validation as a form
    form
    First Name - Last Name
    Email Address Validate @At symbol (built in)
    Username Validate at least 3 characters
    Password - Validate 1 Capital letter, 1 Number and 1 hyphen using regex.

    For each input set the right For, Id and Name for the database to get.
    For each validation implement the correct commentary for the user using colors and symbols taking accessability in mind.

    For this project I will follow the mobile first technique to insure compatibility across platforms and use CanIUse.com and take advantage of fallback properties
    to make sure it works across browsers.


    # What don't I know yet?
    This will be my first time practicing validation, pseudo-elements for validation commentary, gradients and opacity for glass like effect.
    I'll use experimentation and good ol-Google for searching the right techniques for the desired outcome.


    # After thought
    As the project got on I've focus more on the design alone and set aside the compatibility, responsiveness, form grid and validation. although I've learned a lot of CSS from this one, I will make another one with emphasize on these that I've missed and on better 'clean code' practice of CSS.
    That is, using more uniform classes instead of ID and personal design.

    I hope the project is enjoyable for the user and the fellow developers who may see it.
    Thank you for viewing this project.
